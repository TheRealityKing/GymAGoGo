TODO:
*** Deal with database publications - data needs to be private and regulated
   User account restricted content
   Restricted routes
   NOTE: user.profile is autopublished to client ALWAYS, and client ALWAYS
   can change the values inside it. This is extremely bad especially if the
   user tries to update a value such as isAdmin=true; They would now have
   admin privileges!
   Meteor.users.deny({
    update() { return true; }
   });
   This code will deny all client-side updates to the user documents(disabling
   insecure will not change this.)
Profile pages for users

Hero text sizing, text inside button larger
Area under hero/static navbar after scroll past hero
User upload profile pic... RIP
Search routing
